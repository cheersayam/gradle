### Support for Google Cloud Storage backed repositories

It is now possible to consume dependencies from, and publish to, [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) buckets when using [`MavenArtifactRepository`](dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.MavenArtifactRepository.html) or [`IvyArtifactRepository`](dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository.html).

    repositories {
        maven {
            url "gcs://someGcsBucket/maven2"
        }
    
        ivy {
            url "gcs://someGcsBucket/ivy"
        }
    }

Downloading dependencies from Google Cloud Storage is supported for Maven and Ivy type repositories as shown above. Publishing to Google Cloud Storage is supported with both the [Ivy Publishing](userguide/publishing_ivy.html) and [Maven Publishing](userguide/publishing_maven.html) plugins, as well as when using an `IvyArtifactRepository` with an `Upload` task (see section [publishing artifacts of the user guide](userguide/artifact_management.html#sec:publishing_artifacts)).

Please see the [repositories section of the dependency management chapter](userguide/dependency_management.html#sec:repositories) in the user guide for more information on configuring Google Cloud Storage repository access.

### Features for easier plugin authoring

#### Nested DSL elements

While it is easy for a plugin author to extend the Gradle DSL to add top level blocks to the DSL using project extensions, in previous versions of Gradle it was awkward to create a deeply nested DSL inside these top level blocks, often requiring the use of internal Gradle APIs.

In this release of Gradle, API methods have been added to allow a plugin author to create nested DSL elements. See the [example in the user guide](userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:nested_dsl_elements) section on custom plugins.

#### Declaring the output of a task as a publish artifact

In previous versions of Gradle, it was awkward to declare the output of a task as a publish artifact, in a way that deals with changes to the build directory and other configuration. A publish artifact makes a file or directory available to be referenced by a project dependency or published to a binary repository.

TBD: The publish artifact DSL now accepts `Provider<File>`, `Provider<RegularFile>` and `Provider<Directory>` instances, which allows a plugin author to easily wire up a particular task output as a publish artifact in a way that respects configuration changes.

### Safer handling of stale output files

In previous releases, tasks could produce incorrect results when output files were left behind during upgrades or when processes outside of Gradle created files in a shared output directory.
Gradle is able to detect these situations and automatically remove stale files, if it is safe to do so.
Only files within `buildDir`, paths registered as targets for the `clean` task and source set outputs are considered safe to remove.

### CLI abbreviates long test names

In Gradle 4.1, the Gradle CLI began displaying tests in-progress. We received feedback that long packages and test names caused the test name to be truncated or omitted. This version will abbreviate java packages of long test names to 60 characters to make it highly likely to fit on terminal screens. 

### Better support for script plugins loaded via HTTP

Script plugins are applied to Gradle settings or projects via the `apply from: 'URL'` syntax. Support for `http://` and `https://` URLs has been improved in this release:

- HTTP script plugins are cached for [`--offline`](userguide/dependency_management.html#sub:cache_offline) use.
- Download of HTTP script plugins honours [proxy authentication settings](userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

<!--
### Example deprecation
-->

## Potential breaking changes

### Removed `TaskFilePropertyBuilder.withPathSensitivity` and `TaskOutputFilePropertyBuilder.withPathSensitivity`

These methods where not meant to be used, since Gradle does not allow to customize the PathSensitivity for output files.

### Upgraded the bndlib to 3.3.0

Gradle previously depended on `biz.aQute.bnd:biz.aQute.bndlib:3.2.0`. That version of the library didn't support Java 9.
To fix [issue 2583](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/2583), we upgraded to version 3.3.0 of the library. This
should cause no changes as it is a minor version release.

<!--
### Example breaking change
-->

### FindBugs plugin does not render analysis progress anymore

As observed by many users the FindBugs plugin renders a lot of progress information by default leading to longer, unmanageable logs. The output behavior changes with this release. By default the FindBugs plugin will render no more analysis progress. If you happen to post-process the output and relied on the pre-4.2 behavior, then you can enable the progressing logging with the property `FindBugsExtension.showProgress`.
